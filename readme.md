# Main Aim
We propose the dataset as the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05735) said. To try record the dataset automaticly in real-time, We try some different tech.

# Equipment Description
We test the algorithm on a single Frodobot (https://shop.frodobots.com/) with a laptop equipped with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX. The resource is quite limited, We also have the option that using the 4090 or H100 From cluster or computer. But the communication time is also an important consideration.

# SDK Optimization
